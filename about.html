            We do believe that a change cannot be brought with mere ideas. It is the people who make it happen. We exist
            because of the hard work that our team members and farmers put into our Organic farms and production areas.
            Adya Organics believes that women are no less than men and therefore ensures that our staff represents both
            genders. We also buy produce from several women-groups near our farms so that we can encourage them to earn
            a living, thereby, also providing you with local and authentic taste in our products. The women at Adya
            Organics are our backbone, and we truly appreciate their presence and hard work. Without them, Adya Organics
            wouldn’t have its unique identity.

            Likewise, our farmers are our pride. By connecting with them at the base level, we bring you a step closer
            to healthy and organic food. We love supporting them and appreciate the support they lend to us at Adya
            Organics. Together, we vouch to build a healthier future

                <p>
                    if you are one of those people who think buying organic is expensive, think about all the money
                    you’re going to save by not getting ill so frequently and in the long run. We wish for your healthy
                    being and by choosing an organic lifestyle, we can help you achieve exactly that. Especially after
                    COVID, we are now changing our eating patterns and lifestyle to make ourselves survive the pandemic.
                    And why not? We are what we eat. With the increasing use of chemical fertilizers, preservatives, and
                    adulterations in our food, we have forgotten what pure food felt like. Adya Organics is precisely
                    solving that problem by bringing organic to your doorstep.

                <h2>We Are Honest Farmers</h2>
                <p>
                    Our products are 100% organic, pure, natural, unadulterated, preservative-free and chemical-free. We
                    understand that the terms such as “natural”, “organic” or “ayurvedic” are used very loosely by
                    everyone these days. So, it becomes difficult for consumers to identify what is actually good for
                    them and what is not. And how is Adya Organics any different?

                    We call ourselves honest farmers because we believe in honest and transparent food practices. We are
                    also licensed and accredited by FSSAI, India Organic, USDA, USOCA, and BSOCA, making us your
                    one-stop destination for organic food.

            <p>
                Rewinding the clocks to 2001, our brand was back then a dairy which provided unadulterated dairy
                products to the IPS boarding school. At that time, it was the school that consumed most of our produce
                and the rest was sent to the local markets nearby. With the passage of time, the demand for our products
                started rising as the local communities started recognizing it.

                From being a gaushala to now having 4 farms in the country, we have come a long way. Our farms are
                situated in the foothills of Dehradun, Bihar, UP and Jharkhand where we foster each and every product
                with care and purity. We follow hygienic and traditional farming practices inspired completely by Vedic
                Practices at our farms. We produce high quality A2 ghee, milk and butter, along with several other
                products like raw honey, healthy sugar-free cookies, gluten-free flours, cold pressed oils etc. We are
                trying to build a space for local farmers to help them grow immensely by bringing them under the roof of
                Adya Organics, and providing them with employment opportunities & financial stability. We wish to build
                an inclusive community of local farmers and continue to serve as a medium for them to sell their
                produce.
